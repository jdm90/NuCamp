Bootstrap Overview:

3 things you always need to create Bootstrap grid:
Container, row, column

Containers hold rows, rows hold columns
All content (text and images) go inside columns

Bootstrap containers are centered in the viewport by default

.container-fluid stretches full width of container and changes fluidly every time you change browser size

Bootstrap rows = 12 columns

<div class="col col-md-6 col-lg-8">For responsive column sizing based on viewport</div>
